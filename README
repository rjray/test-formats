Test::Formats - Perform unit tests that examine structured/formatted text

Version: 0.10

WHAT IS IT

The Test::Formats package provides Test::More-style test routines for
examining text that adheres to specific structure or formats. XML content,
for example, is not just tested to see that a document is well-formed, it is
tested against a DTD, XML Schema or RelaxNG schema to determine if the
content is actually valid.

Initial release. All basic functionality for the Test::Formats::XML
specialization is in place, but test coverage is embarrassing.
