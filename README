Test::Formats - Perform unit tests that examine structured/formatted text

Version: 0.11

WHAT IS IT

The Test::Formats package provides Test::More-style test routines for
examining text that adheres to specific structure or formats. XML content,
for example, is not just tested to see that a document is well-formed, it is
tested against a DTD, XML Schema or RelaxNG schema to determine if the
content is actually valid.

CHANGES

MANIFEST:
lib/Test/Formats/XML.pm:
t/10_xml/05_xml_parsing.t:
Added testing routines to Test::Formats::XML to simple test that XML
content is well-formed. Tests only the parsing, no validation. Added
test suite for this, and added the suite file to MANIFEST.

Build.PL:
Makefile.PL:
Besides bumping the version number, added some clean-up to the
overall meta-information so that pre-reqs, etc., are better
spelled-out.
