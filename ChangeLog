        lib/Test/Formats/XML.pm:
        t/10_xml/10_sgmldtd.t:
        t/10_xml/20_xmlschema.t:
        t/10_xml/30_relaxng.t:
        t/90_integration/10_with_xml.t:
        t/90_integration/90_empty_subclass.t:
        Per suggestions from Schwern, added <type>_ok aliases for the
        tests, and also swapped the order of the $document and $schema
        arguments to all the tests. While at it, added tests for each of the
        three schema-types to test the aliases directly.

        lib/Test/Formats/XML.pm:
        Follow-up the previous with carrying over the argument-ordering change
        to the is_valid_against() subroutine. Also fleshed out some overlooked
        (i.e., forgotten) documentation for is_well_formed_xml().

        MANIFEST:
        lib/Test/Formats/XML.pm:
        t/10_xml/05_xml_parsing.t:
        Added testing routines to Test::Formats::XML to simple test that XML
        content is well-formed. Tests only the parsing, no validation. Added
        test suite for this, and added the suite file to MANIFEST.

        Build.PL:
        Makefile.PL:
        Besides bumping the version number, added some clean-up to the
        overall meta-information so that pre-reqs, etc., are better
        spelled-out.

        t/90_integration/90_empty_subclass.t:
        t/90_integration/MyTestFormats.pm:
        Initial release. All basic functionality for the Test::Formats::XML
        specialization is in place, but test coverage is embarrassing.
